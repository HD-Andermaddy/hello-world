# hello-world

My very first repository in GitHub initiated by the CS50 course at Harvard.

Hi 

Andermaddy here, I am exited to learn so many new things just within a couple of hours. 
I am absolutely new to GitHub. I have never used GitHub before. 
However, at least I knew it does exist, because my development colleagues are using it for quite a while. 

I am still eager to learn new things all the time. That is why I have joined CS50 at the beginning. 

BTW, HD-Andermaddy is a contribution to an old nickname of me and the town Heidelberg/Gernmany.
